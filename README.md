# NumberGameAssignment
A NumberGame project I wrote for my Pre-AP CSI class.

For this project, you will be using some things that we have learned and some things that we haven't. I want to see how resourceful you are, because programming sometimes asks us to do things we don't yet understand.

Here's what I want you to do:\

1. I want our user to control whether or not they play our game again. They should be prompted with something like "Do you want to play again? (Y/N)"
  If they enter Y, they should start a new game.
  If they enter N, the game should thank them for playing and then terminate.
  
2. So far our user can only guess a number between one and ten. What is they want more of a challenge? They should be able to control the range variable to update the game at the beginning. Make the proper changes to allow the user to control the range.

3. Say that the user changes the game to be at a range of 1-1000. We would still be giving them only three chances to guess the number. That seems a bit difficult. Create a solution to allow the user to set the number of guesses they will have, so that they can control the difficulty. 

4. Our user never knows how close the are to the number. Create a solution that allows them to:
   Know how far away from the number they are, and whether the number they guesses is too high or too low.
